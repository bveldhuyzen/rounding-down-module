#Rounds any number down to the nearest (multiple of) any specified decimal(s).

#To be configured before use is marked with ###
#
#Furthermore, the script works as followed:
#
#1. The numerical value (any number) that is to be rounded down is obtained; this is called the FULL_NUMBER // see line 25-26
#2. The numerical value (decimal(s)) to which [1] has to be rounded down to is obtained; the module will round down to the nearest (multiple of) this specified numerical value (decimal(s)) // see line 36-37
#3. Of the numerical value [1] is obtained its integer, for which a new variable is created
#4. Of the numerical value [1] are obtained the decimals, for which a new variable is created
#5. A multiplication factor is generated; how many times does [2] fit into [4]
#6. The numerical value to round down to at [2] is multiplied by the multiplication factor of [5], resulting in a new decimal numerical value that is rounded down to [2]. 
#7. The numerical value at [6] is now rounded down to the nearest (multiple of) specified decimals at [2]. And so we can add up: INTEGER + NEW_DECIMALS = ROUNDED_NUMBER
