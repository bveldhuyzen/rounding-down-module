#
#The script works as followed:
#
#1. The numerical value (from list) that is to be rounded down becomes a variable; this is called the FULL_NUMBER // see line 26
#2. The numerical value (decimal(s)) to which [1] has to be rounded down to is obtained; the module will round down to the nearest (multiple of) specified decimal(s) // see line 32-33
#3. Of the numerical value [1] is obtained its integer, for which a new variable is created
#4. Of the numerical value [1] are obtained the decimals, for which a new variable is created
#5. A multiplication factor is generated; how many times does [2] fit into [4]
#6. The numerical value to round down to at [2] is multiplied by the multiplication factor of [5], resulting in a new (decimal) numerical value that is rounded down to [2]
#7. And so we can add up: INTEGER + NEW_DECIMALS = ROUNDED_NUMBER
#8. ROUNDED_NUMBER is then logged into a text file
#
#All steps/significances are logged into temporary text files for validation purposes
