#Rounds any number down to the nearest (multiple of) specified decimal(s).

#To be configured before use is marked with ###
#
#The script works as followed:
#
#1. The number (from list) that is to be rounded down becomes a variable; this is called the FULL_NUMBER // see line 22
#2. The decimals to which [1] has to be rounded down to are obtained; the module will round down to the nearest (multiple of) these specified decimals // see line 25
#3. A multiplication factor is generated; how many times does [2] fit into [1]
#4. In case the multiplication factor is not a whole number, the multiplication factor will be its integer
#5. The numerical value to round down to at [2] is multiplied by the multiplication factor of [3], resulting in a new numerical value that is rounded down to [2]
#6. ROUNDED_NUMBER is then logged into a text file
#
#
#All steps/significances are logged into temporary text files for validation purposes
