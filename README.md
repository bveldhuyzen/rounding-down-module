# rounding-down-module
Rounds any number down to the nearest (multiple of) specified decimal(s).

Also available now as stand-alone version to apply rounding to lists. See rounding-down-module-for-lists folder. Rounds numbers from list down to the nearest (multiple of) specified decimal(s). See for example list.txt (original) and LIST_DATE_TEST.txt (rounded numbers). Currently accepts the following list format: one numerical value to round down per line; any amount of lines; dots as separator for integer and decimals.

v1.01 Calculates the nearest (multiple of) specified decimals with the integer as starting point (e.g. with rounding down set at 0.75, the number 1,55 will round down to 1.00)

v1.02 Calculates the nearest (multiple of) specified decimals with 0 (zero) as starting point (e.g. with rounding down set at 0.75, the number 1,55 will round down  to 1.50)
